We then learned how to handle missing or null values by either removing columns with these values using the dropna command or filling them with the mean of the available data using the fillna command. Additionally, we practiced inserting new values into the data without disturbing the index values.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FNZjfOJlOT-H"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":142},"id":"BkB2LpNFWl18","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720677358026,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30505,"user":{"displayName":"Dhruv Kangavkar","userId":"12293339075973793714"}},"outputId":"12eda92c-06f6-451d-a92b-c9ced6e0ff93"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-57bb6ee7-fb2d-4178-b3e3-ae60eb618bab\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-57bb6ee7-fb2d-4178-b3e3-ae60eb618bab\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
