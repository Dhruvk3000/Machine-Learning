Missing Indicator: Add a binary feature to indicate if data is missing.\n","\n","3. Surrogate Splits: Use alternative splits for handling missing values during tree construction.\n","4.

This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into building decision trees, a core technique in supervised learning. We started by exploring the ID3 algorithm, which relies on entropy and information gain to iteratively split the data and form the tree. The experiment successfully demonstrated the practical application of the ID3 algorithm, enhancing our overall understanding of machine learning techniques."],"metadata":{"id":"3mHyeLoo20cH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"id":"a8k5r8ShqtWK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724912449674,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":479,"user":{"displayName":"Dhruv Kangavkar","userId":"12293339075973793714"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import io\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree\n","from sklearn import tree"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","uploaded = files.upload()\n","\n","# Print the keys in the uploaded dictionary\n","print(\"Keys in uploaded:\", uploaded.keys())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":90},"id":"0DP6n3rhszYs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724911562154,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13727,"user":{"displayName":"Dhruv Kangavkar","userId":"12293339075973793714"}},"outputId":"158fbdf0-1f2b-4cf5-de5f-5d2d78bdf502"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-d8242044-5ccf-4ad3-b578-50ee6d8c58ad\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-d8242044-5ccf-4ad3-b578-50ee6d8c58ad\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
